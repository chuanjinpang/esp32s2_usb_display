 * \brief Memory buffer
 *
 * Buffer is very similar to the native C array.
 * The size of Buffer is fixed when the Buffer is created, and you can use copy contructor or assign operator to create a clone of a Buffer
 * The only way to access the internal data of Buffer is to use the lock() method to lock the data and avoid other thread's access to the data.
 * After usage, you need to invoke the unlock method to release the buffer.
