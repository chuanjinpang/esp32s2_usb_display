libusbx
=======

libusbx is a library for USB device access from Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows and OpenBSD/NetBSD userspace, with OpenBSD/NetBSD, and to a
lesser extent some of the newest features of Windows (such as libusbK
and libusb-win32 driver support) being EXPERIMENTAL.
It is written in C and licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 2.1 or, at your option, any later version (see COPYING).

libusbx is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems. Please see the PORTING file
for more information.
